Im still very new to adding respository and had to make the code look like a list on the read me until i figure out how to use Github properly...
# 5.4.3-Calculate-a-Factorial
zyDE 5.4.3: Calculate a Factorial, here is the solution that I was able to put together after reading other examples that made the code work but not the way it was asking for. The lab is as is.
# The question.
Write a program that lets a user enter N and that outputs N! (N factorial, meaning N*(N-1)*(N-2)*...*2*1). Hint:Use a loop variable i that counts from total-1 down to 1. 
Compare your output with some of these answers: 1:1, 2:2, 3:6, 4:24, 5:120, 8:40320.
# The code space provided that needs edit.
- N = int(input())   Read user-entered number
- total = N
- Initialize the loop variable
- while i ? ??:
- Set total to total * (i)
- Decrement i
- print(total)
